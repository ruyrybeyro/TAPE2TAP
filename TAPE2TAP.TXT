
Tape2tap v1.20 --- digitalizes spectrum tapes in a PC (MS-DOS)
		   through a SoundBlaster or the printer port

	Introduction
	------------

	First of all, will introduce myself: I am a Portuguese student
(born 12/09/70). I have already worked  3 years at a  Software house in C
and sometimes in assembly.  

	Hope you enjoy this tiny program. I have tested it a lot and found it
is now in a reliable state to distribute it.

	I did  Tape2Tap as a preliminary preparation to a Spectrum emulation 
under Windows; if it all comes right this emulation will be due by April'96.
[No it don't...May'96, that's is...].

	Tape2Tap is  compatible will  versions of DOS up from 3.0 (including 
Windows'95 - enclosed should come a TAPE2TAP.PIF);

	This program is postware, so  if  you like it and want to use it, you 
should (well at least you can try to...) send a postcard about you homeland to 
the following address:

		Rui Ribeiro
		Av. Carvalha, 280 3o. D
		P-4420 Gondomar
		Portugal

	If you really will send a postcard, tell me where you get the program, 
(if in Internet write the address  where you  get it)! I can read English, 
French, Spanish and Portuguese,  so you do not have any excuse! Of course, if 
you want to send any money, I will make no objections...

	Hope Tape2Tap will be of any use to you.

	If you want spectrum Software and you don't have Internet acess,
try this BBS:

			MiCroRun BBS    [Oporto, Portugal]

		     (351)02-5104669  [28800]
		  or (351)02-5106214  [14400]

	This BBS also has loads of Spectrum software. I left there almost
my entire collection, but I think they are in a private area. Talk to the 
co-sysop if you want to know more about that!

	I am registered as Star Man there, but at the moment I am not in 
Portugal.


	Instructions
	------------

	You call Tape2Tap and:

	. if you have a SoundBlaster, it will autodetect it and will try to use
	it (if for some reason you do not want to autodected SoundBlaster use 
	the /ds option: disable SoundBlaster detection)

	. if you don't have a SoundBlaster it will try to digitalize data from 
	the Printer Port

	The data will be saved in W1.TAP (in Z80 format) at the current
directory. If W1.TAP does not exist, it will be created. If not, data will be 
appended  to it. If a block gives an error it will be not saved, so you have to 
rewind and try to load the block again. (a recorder with a counter will be 
handy.)
	
	You notice that something is being read by Tape2Tap as the old ways: 
the colours of the stripes change. (unfamiliar, uh?)

	When Tape2Tap can read a block successfully, it will the display the 
familiar 'Program:' or  'Bytes:' message followed by the corresponding name...
so in the very first block of the tape you should get no errors and the name 
right...if you did not you must try some different tape volume or something.
(were not you missing this in your PC?)

	Inside Tape2Tap you can use 5 keys:

     - ESC -- exit program (don't do that, unless you are finished with the 
	current block)
     - 'S' -- turn PC speaker on  (to hear this sounds forgotten long ago by 
	humanity)
     - 'N' -- turn PC speaker off (the original Spectrum ought to do that!)
     - '1' -- disable CRC checking (use with extreme care! You are in fact 
	disabling error checking...but there are software protections that 
	change the CRC)
     - '2' -- enable CRC (when you skip the offending block, restore this as 
	SOON AS POSSIBLE!)
     - 'P' -- starting using the printer port instead the SoundBlaster as the
        inputing device

	The cables
	----------

	If you are fortunate  enough to have a SoundBlaster and still your
Spectrum cable, you can go pick it, and plug it to SoundBlaster's Line In the 
corresponding place in your tape recorder (Line Out,Ear).

	Anyway if you have a SoundBlaster, it suffices to get a cable to 
connect the Line IN to your tape recorders Line Out or Ear.



	To the more unfortunate people (like me):

	* You can buy one tape adapter from BG services, UK; it's compatible.

	Or you can build it yourself:

	. you need a 25-pin D-type connector (just like the one that plugs your 
	printer to your computer)
	. a jack connector to plug to tape recorder
	. some cable

	For those more technically oriented I have here a design that

	  I just find this lying around so if you decide to use it don't
	blame me if it doesn't work. If however, you can put it to work,
	could you send me a email?).

	Technical Details
	-----------------

	Tape2Tap was designed  to work in any computer, at any speed. To
accomplish this feat it uses only 8086 opcodes, and uses the PIT to time the
tape data.

	It controls the SoundBlaster directly, without any use of DMA (so in
theory, it will work with no problems with SoundBlaster compatibles).

	Between block of tapes, all data is output to disk, so I have no idea
how it will behave with diskettes (sorry!).

	Tape2Tap manages to load almost all tapes at regular or turbo speed.
This strength  is also is weakness:  to cope with this, I cannot assume
transition times, so the program is more vulnerable to tape errors! There is
only one kind of protection that Tape2Tap cannot cope: a silence in the middle
of a block!

	I did what I  could with sound sampling, but I think very noisy tapes
will not get much  chance with this program: if your tape is original you are
lucky.

	Of course, if you digitalize turbo tapes, the emulator must recognise
them or you must hack  the program. Well, this program was my answer for not
having to hack the program. IF YOU HAVE TURBO TAPES DIGITALIZED YOU MUST GET
'WARAJEVO'  SPECTRUM  EMULATOR AND CONVERT THE  TAPE FILES WITH THE UTILITY
ENCLOSED... (if you can get to Internet try at:
		fpt://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/sinclair/utils/pc )

	If you are having problems, try to not use any memory manager.

To do:

  I am done with Tape2Tap! You are free to correct and improve it. For this
people, the documents I am providing in the SBDOCS directory will be extremely
useful. If you are sucefful, don't forget that other people may be insterested.
And include all this files, beside your own new ones...

	Regards,
	Rui
